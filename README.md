# News Aggregator

The goal of my website will be to allow users to create accounts and search for, browse, and save news articles. The demographic of my users will be all ages (anyone who wants to read news articles), and could be from any country. I plan to use data from Microsoftâ€™s Bing News Search API which will include headlines, descriptions of articles and links to articles. I think this data will be sufficient for the functionality I want to include.

Roughly speaking, I plan to store data about users including personal info such as login credentials as well as stories that they save and maybe certain preferences if I make it that far. I also plan to store data for comments. Issues I could run into with my API include retrieving and utilizing data the way I want to, but the Bing API seems pretty robust so I hope that it is a straightforward process.

The functionality or flow that I am hoping for is a user can visit the site and see trending or popular articles. From there, they will have the ability to create an account or sign in to their existing account. Once logged in, a user should be able to see stories they have saved and have the ability to comment on stories. Some additional features I would like to implement include user preferences such as preferred topics and region as well as the ability to suggest related stories.
