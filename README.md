# Capstone-Project

The goal of this website will be to allow users to browse and save food recipes. Users should be able to create accounts, save recipes to their accounts and comment on existing recipes to share their feedback. I intend for the site to accommodate cooks of all ages and varying skill levels, but geared more towards beginners. I plan to use data that includes recipes and ideally additional information about those recipes such as ingredients, techniques and cuisine. 

As of right now, my database will include models for Users, Recipes, Saved Recipes, Comments, Tags and Recipe Tags. For what I envision, I think these tables will be enough to store the data and relationships I need. As far as the API goes, I think that retrieving recipe data should be straightforward although I am not sure about what limitations there may be for free access. The only sensitive information I plan on capturing is a user’s email address and password for their account. 

Users will be able to go to the homepage of the site and see some recommended/popular recipes. From the homepage, they can search for recipes using keywords, or browse recipes based on certain criteria such as ingredients, cuisine, or cooking technique. From the homepage they can also register/login to their own account, from which they can view their saved recipes. While viewing a recipe, users will be able to save that recipe, view comments and add their own comments.

Some additional functionality I would potentially like to include is the ability for users to add new recipes as well as a way to recommend new recipes to users based on what recipes they’ve saved or what recipe they are currently viewing.
